# Map Challenge

Hi!, in this Challenge, we will provide you with an Array of objects that contains positioning data, and you must render this locations in a map component.

## Requeriments

You will need to:

    -Create a new git branch with the first letter of your first name and your last name like in the following example:
        for the user "Carlos Ramirez" the name of the branch would be cramirez, all of it in lower case


    -Start a new project using any JavaScript frontend framework. We recommend the latest versions of React/Next or Vue/Nuxt frameworks.

    -Create a function that iterates in the data array (it is in the ./assets/positionsData.js file contained in this repository) and each second modifies the location in the map to simulate the device movement in real time

    -It is mandatory to use eslint/prettier to format the code.

    -It is forbbiden to use Material UI, Element UI or any other library that provides you pre-build components apart from those mentioned in the hints section below

    -Push to github regulary code changes, avoid making a single or a few confirmations, the commits must be a sample of your work

    -Once you complete the challenge, please name the last commit "final commit"

     -You have 48 hours to make this challenge from the moment you are granted access to this repository. Don't worry if you cant't finish it, the final result isn't the only criteria to evalute you, we want to see your  performance in other aspects related with software development

## Hints

We suggest you use:

    -Leaflet library to render the map .

    -Tailwind CSS for app styles.

    -React Icons to render tracker positions

    -You can use Set interval from Javascript API to change the position device state regularly

## Extra points

You will gain extra points if you:

    -Dockerize the app, using docker-compose

    -Create Responsive design.

    -Use Typescript instead of Javascript

    -Aplly good coding practices such as consistent and clear variable names, modularization, and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SOLID).
